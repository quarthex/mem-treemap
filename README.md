# mem-treemap

A toy to see memory usage in a [treemap] using [Electron] and [D3.js].  
Yes, it consumes a lot of memory.  
Yes, it also consumes a lot of CPU.  
No, I don't care.

## Quick start

Abandon NPM. Get [Yarn], it worths the move.

```sh
~ yarn
~ yarn prod
~ yarn dist
```

The exectuable should live in `dist`.

## TODO

Do you love Windows? I don't. Feel free to make a pull request.

## License

No.
